# secretsantarator
This is a simple python code to help you randomly generate a secret santa draw.

All you need to do is download this code and run it in a command line using:
`python secretsantarator.py`

The program will then prompt you for the number of participants and then ask you to enter each participant's name one at a time. At the end of the program, you'll get a jolly greeting from everyone's favorite resident of the North Pole and his assignments for your secret santa event.
